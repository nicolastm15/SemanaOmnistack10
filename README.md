# Dev Radar

This Project is a tinder-like system for someone to find developers based on location and technologies mastered. It was developed during **Rocketseat's 10th OmniStack Week** using NodeJS, React Native and ReactJS.

The project consists of three folders: **backend**, **web**, and **mobile**.

- The backend is a NodeJS server integrated to a MongoDB instance;
- The web part is written in ReactJS and is where you register the devs, entering information like name, location, technologies mastered and github user page;
- The mobile part is in React Native and shows the devs in your area as pins on a map.
