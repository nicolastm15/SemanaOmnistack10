# Dev Radar

This Project is a tinder-like system for someone to find developers based on location and technologies mastered. It was developed during **Rocketseat's 10th OmniStack Week** using NodeJS, React Native and ReactJS with the guidance of [@diego3g](https://github.com/diego3g).

The project consists of three folders: **backend**, **web**, and **mobile**.

- The backend part of the project is a javascript server that forwards requests to a MongoDB instance installed on the server machine and then creates responses for client apps (web or mobile);
- The web part is written in reactJS and is where you register the devs, entering things like name, location, technologies mastered and github user page;
- The mobile part shows the devs in your area as pins on a map and allows you to select one to view more information and then open a webview of his or her github page.
